# This is the README file for my Start-up for CS260
## My current Idea is to create a website for Longboarders in Provo to meet up
### Part of this inspiration comes from the Spikeball app, which allows players 
### to meet up and see what events are going on near them
For this to work, I will need to learn a bunch of web dev coding skills, as well as learn how to create and maintain at least a chat web appliction, if not a map-based application as well. This could very well be the biggest project I have ever worked on since starting college!
