# This is the README file for LongboardLinkup
## LongboardLinkup is a web app designed to help longboarders meet up and plan events in Provo, UT.
Part of this inspiration comes from the Spikeball app, which allows players 
to meet up and see what events are going on near them

## Description

Spending time outdoors and moving is good for your mental health. Why not augemnt and share these amazing benefits through a LongboardLinkup? See what events are going on around you, or plan one yourself. Make new friends and coordinate schedules for even more fun üëç
