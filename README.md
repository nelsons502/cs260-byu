# This is the README file for LongboardLinkup<sup>TM</sup>
## LongboardLinkup is a web app designed to help longboarders meet up and plan events in Provo, UT.
Part of this inspiration comes from the Spikeball app, which allows players 
to meet up and see what events are going on near them

## Description
### Elevator Pitch




For this to work, I will need to learn a bunch of web dev coding skills, as well as learn how to create and maintain at least a chat web appliction, if not a map-based application as well. This could very well be the hugest project I have ever worked on since starting college!
