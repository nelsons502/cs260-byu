I am learning how to code in HTML, how to use Markdown, and how to use GitHub. This is a super practical and fun class!


For this to work, I will need to learn a bunch of web dev coding skills, as well as learn how to create and maintain at least a chat web appliction, if not a map-based application as well. This could very well be the hugest project I have ever worked on since starting college!

I just set up my first website! It was cool to see how servers, IP addresses and Domain names work together to help a browser located the correct website. I'm excited to learn more about HTTPS
